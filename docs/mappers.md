# Mapper support

VirtuaNES for 3DS reads the iNES 1.0 header, so it knows mapper numbers 0 to 255. Of those, `CreateMapper()` in `src/cores/virtuanes/NES/MapperFactory.cpp` handles 197, plus 20 UNIF boards and the NSF player. This page lists the other 59.

Version 1.03 added mappers 30, 37, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159, 207 and 210. Each has a generated test ROM in `tools/azahar/mappertest.py` that checks its bank switching and mirroring in the emulator (see the readme); that's also the quickest way to test a new mapper.

The makers come from the icons in the NESdev wiki's iNES 1.0 mapper grid (the September 2026 export of the [Mapper](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Mapper) page). The names are FCEUX's (`src/ines.cpp`) where it has one. Names marked † are from memory and should be checked against the mapper's NESdev page before implementing.

## Numbers that don't need an implementation

NESdev marks 39, 84, 102, 129, 130, 131, 146, 161, 213, 223 and 224 as bad assignments: duplicates of other mappers (146 is mapper 79, 213 is mapper 58) or numbers that were never used consistently. A ROM with one of these numbers is best fixed with the right number in its header. 98 is reserved, and 239 and 247 have no known assignment.

## NES 2.0 mappers (256 and up)

The NES 2.0 header format extends mapper numbers to 4095 and adds submappers. The wiki lists 267 assigned numbers in the 256 to 767 range, mostly Chinese pirate boards, multicarts and educational computers. VirtuaNES can't load any of them yet. It reads the mapper number from the iNES 1.0 bytes only (`ROM.cpp`, `(header.control1>>4)|(header.control2&0xF0)`), so an NES 2.0 ROM with a mapper above 255 loads as the wrong mapper. Recognising the NES 2.0 header is the first step before adding any of these.

## Where to start

29, 31 and 218 are small homebrew boards. Among the rest, the MMC3 variants and multicarts (205, 215, 219, 238, 250 and friends) mostly reuse mapper 4's logic with different register decoding or an outer bank register on top. `Mapper004` has `PRGBank()` and `CHRBank()` hooks for exactly that: mapper 37 (`Mapper037`) is the example, an outer bank register in about 20 lines.
