## VirtuaNES for 3DS

VirtuaNES for 3DS is a high compatibility NES emulator for your old 3DS or 2DS. It's not as accurate as FCEUX or Nestopia, but it runs at full 60 FPS for almost all games, and supports tonnes of mappers: MMC1,3,5,6; VRC1,2,3,4,6,7; and tonnes of other mappers. As a result, the library of games it supports are huge. 

This 3DS version also fixes a few bugs from VirtuaNES's MMC5 mappers and even plays Rockman 4 Minus Infinity and Zelda Legend of Link hacks.

It also runs on your New 3DS as well!

### Homebrew Launcher:

1. Copy virtuanes_3ds.3dsx, virtuanes_3ds.smdh and virtuanes_3ds_top.png into the /3ds/virtuanes_3ds folder on your SD card.
2. Place your ROMs inside any folder.
3. Go to your Homebrew Launcher (either via Cubic Ninja, Soundhax or other entry points) and launch the virtuanes_3ds emulator.

### CIA Version:

1. Use your favorite CIA installer to install virtuanes_3ds.cia into your CFW. You can also use FBI to download from TitleDB.
2. Place your ROMs inside any folder.
3. Copy virtuanes_3ds_top.png to ROOT of your SD card.
4. Exit your CIA installer and go to your CFW's home screen to launch the app.

### FDS BIOS

1. To load .FDS games, make sure that you get the FDS BIOS.
2. Rename the BIOS to disksys.rom and place it in /3ds/virtuanes_3ds/bios/disksys.rom

### Box art and screenshot previews

While you browse the ROM list, the top screen can show box art and a screenshot of the highlighted game. Put them on your SD card as PNG files named like the ROM, without its extension:

1. Box art: /3ds/virtuanes_3ds/boxart/Super Mario Bros. 3.png (shown on the left, up to 176x200: 150x200 for an NES box, 176x132 for a Famicom cover, 176x176 for a Famicom Disk System cover)
2. Screenshot: /3ds/virtuanes_3ds/snaps/Super Mario Bros. 3.png (shown at 200x175, on the right)

Images at those sizes load fastest and look best; larger ones are scaled down to fit. A game with only one of the two images shows it in the middle of the screen, and games without either image show the title image instead.

[tools/make_previews.py](tools/make_previews.py) makes these from bigger images, for example from a libretro-thumbnails pack ([NES](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/Nintendo_-_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), [Famicom Disk System](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/Nintendo_-_Family_Computer_Disk_System)). It needs Python 3 and Pillow (`pip install pillow`):

    python3 tools/make_previews.py --boxarts Named_Boxarts --snaps Named_Snaps --roms path/to/your/roms --out previews

Then copy the boxart and snaps folders from previews to /3ds/virtuanes_3ds/ on the SD card. With --roms, the images are named after your ROM files, and ROMs named differently from the pack's images (Tennis.nes against "Tennis (Japan, USA)") are matched by title.

### When in-game,

1. Tap the bottom screen for the menu.
2. Use Up/Down to choose option, and A to confirm. (Hold down X while pressing Up/Down to Page Up/Page Down)
3. Use Left/Right to change between ROM selection and emulator options.
4. You can quit the emulator to your homebrew launcher / your CFW's home screen.

## Change History

*VirtuaNES:*

### v1.03
- Builds with current devkitARM (libctru 2.x) on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- The top screen always runs in 2D mode (the 3D slider no longer changes it).
- Runs in the Azahar and Citra emulators (without sound).
- Box art and screenshot previews on the top screen in the ROM list (see above), with room for NES, Famicom and Famicom Disk System covers.
- New mappers: 30 (UNROM 512, including games that save by reprogramming their flash ROM; those saves go in a .flash file next to the ROM), 37 (Super Mario Bros. + Tetris + Nintendo World Cup), 152, 153 (Famicom Jump II), 154 (Devil Man), 155 (MMC1A), 157 (Datach, without the barcode reader), 158 (Alien Syndrome), 159 (Bandai 24C01 EEPROM games), 207 (Fudou Myouou Den) and 210 (Namco 175/340: Family Circuit '91, Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti, Famista '92-'94 and others).
- The CIA now has a title version (1.0.3), so it installs as an upgrade of older versions.

### v1.02
- Fixed bug in MMC5 mapper that was causing Castlevania 3's graphics to corrupt.
- Optimized rendering to 16-bit buffer to reduce cache misses, and minor optimizations for MMC5 rendering.
- Fixed occassional crashing bug when loading a ROM.

### v1.01
- Fixed cheats (previously cheats couldn't be activated whatever you did)
- Fixed mapper problem in Kabuki Quantum Fighter

### v1.00
- Added key mappings to fast forward (capped at 180 FPS), and open the emulator menu.
- Updated configuration menu
- Added feature to auto-save state
- Migrated and fixed some mappers from VirtuaNESEx (thanks to the authors of VirtualNESEx) 
- The following mappers are fixed/added: 4, 7, 16, 23, 34, 47, 49, 52, 65, 69, 71, 73, 74, 86, 91, 92, 121, 132, 141, 148, 150, 162, 163, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 189, 190, 194, 198, 199, 212, 235, 237, 240, 241, 252

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## .CHX Cheat File format

The .CHX is a cheat file format that you can create with any text editor. Each line in the file corresponds to one cheat, and is of the following format:

     [Y/N],[CheatCode],[Name]

1. [Y/N] represents whether the cheat is enabled. Whenever you enable/disable it in the emulator, the .CHX cheat file will be modified to save your changes.
2. [CheatCode] must be an NES Game Genie 6- or 8-character cheat code. An NES Game-Genie code looks like this: **GXOUSUSE**.
3. [Name] is a short name that represents this cheat. Since this will appear in the emulator, keep it short (< 30 characters). 

The .CHX must have the same name as your ROM. This is an example of a .CHX file:

Filename: **8x8 Eyes.CHX**
```
Y,GXOUSUSE,Most attacks won't damage Orin
Y,GXNGNOSE,Most attacks won't damage Cutrus
```

NOTE: If you enable a cheat, and then disable it, you may need to reset the game for the disabling to take effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Build

The current version can be built in two ways:

###  libctru v1.0.0

You will need:
- devkitARM r45
- libctru v1.0.0
- citro3d v1.0.0

Then build by using *make*.
